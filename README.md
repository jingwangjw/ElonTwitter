Analyze Market Moving Twitter Personalities. Predict how the influential user (Elon Musk) effects the stock price.

In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that he “[is] considering taking Tesla private at $420” and that “funding is secured” [1]. Within the next four hours, TSLA’ s market cap increased by $12 billion. [2] As a matter of fact, some of Elon’s controversial tweets have had a history of moving Tesla’s share prices significantly. Recent similar events include how Snapchat stock price plummeted after Kylie Jenner’s tweet and how Trump’s tweets have affected the US stock market. [3][4] Consequently, we are interested in examining whether the tweets of other celebrities or influencers on Twitter also possess the power to sway share prices of well-known companies or the market in general. Our project aims to discover characteristics from tweets that contribute to the prediction of trading volume changes and discover market-moving twitter personalities.
